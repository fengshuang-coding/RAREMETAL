# RAREMETAL
RAREMETAL was developed during my PhD study and research in University of Michigan at Ann Arbor (2010-2015). It was first released in 2013 and published in <em>Bioinformatics</em> in 2014.

This RAREMETAL is a combined package of RAREMETAL, a single-variant and gene-level meta analysis tool, and RAREMETALWORKER, a computational tool to analyze individual samples and generate summary statistics using linear mixed model to correct population stratification, hidden relatedness, family relatedness coded by pedigree, and data quality issues.

RAREMETAL meta-analyzes summary statistics generated by RAREMETALWORKER at single-variant level or group-of-variants (gene) level.

RAREMETAL AND RAREMETALWORKER were developed and built to be compatible to Linux (tested on Red Hat, Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS systems), Mac OS, and PCs with Windows operating systems.
